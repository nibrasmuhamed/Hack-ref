## Information disclosure.
simply call API
sometimes you may need to find hidden endpoints by enumerating the API.
Make a judgment call

## Authorisation isses
Understanding the autherisation process. what API is being called? what tocken are generated? what tockens do you need? what end points need them?
can use the API to generate tockens without the need to login
can you use another API endpoint to access functionality without needing a tocken

## Business logic errors.
if you see a number, make it really large. 
if you see a number, make it negative
will api let you move on without paying.

## IDOR's
use burp repeater to repeat each request to each endpoint
remove your cookies, does it still work
replace your cookies, does it still work?

## XSS and CSRF
find request to api which takes someinput and reflects it.
send the XSS payload to api

find an api endpoint which does not have or does not need csrf tocken
