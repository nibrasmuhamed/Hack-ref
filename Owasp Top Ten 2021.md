The Open Web Application Security ProjectÂ® (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. Through community-led open-source software projects, hundreds of local chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and leading educational and training conferences, the OWASP Foundation is the source for developers and technologists to secure the web.

# 1. Broken Access Control

Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the user's limits. Common access control vulnerabilities include:

-   Violation of the principle of least privilege or deny by default, where access should only be granted for particular capabilities, roles, or users, but is available to anyone.
    
-   Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL (parameter tampering or force browsing), internal application state, or the HTML page, or by using an attack tool modifying API requests.
    
-   Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account, by providing its unique identifier (insecure direct object references)
    
-   Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE.
    
-   Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in or acting as an admin when logged in as a user.
    
-   Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token (JWT) access control token, or a cookie or hidden field manipulated to elevate privileges or abusing JWT invalidation.
    
-   CORS misconfiguration allows API access from unauthorized/untrusted origins.
    
-   Force browsing to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user or to privileged pages as a standard user.


## Test Scenarios
Users In different levels:
	- normal user
	- admin
	- super user
	- audit
webapp.com/admin_info
webapp.com/acctinfo?acct=1234

 Totally depend on authentication and session managment
 - **authentication** is identifying persons that they are who they are saying.
 - **session managment** identifying which subsequent HTTP requests are being made by that same user.
 - **access control** detemines whether the user is allowed to carry out the acrion that they are attempting to perform.

### Broken access control from userside
- vertical access control 
- horizontal access control
- context-dependent access controls

#### vertical access control
web apps  have different previleged user like admin and user. admin have the previlege to delete user account. in short admin have more privileges than user. 

#### Horizontal access control
horizontal access controls is accessing another users data within our account. this mechanism access to resources to the users who are specifically allowed to access those resources.

#### Context-dependent access controls
context-dependent access control depend on user's interaction. for example a retail web site won't  allow users to modify contents after their payment.

#### Examples of broken access controls

Broken access control vulnerabilities exist when a user can in fact access some resource or perform some action that they are not supposed to be able to access.

#### Vertical privilege escalation

If a user can gain access to functionality that they are not permitted to access then this is vertical privilege escalation. For example, if a non-administrative user can in fact gain access to an admin page where they can delete user accounts, then this is vertical privilege escalation.
