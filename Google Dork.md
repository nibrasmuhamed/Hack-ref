# Google Dork

Google is arguably the most famous example of “Search Engines”
"Search Engines" such as Google are huge indexers – specifically, indexers of content spread across the World Wide Web.

These essentials in surfing the internet use “Crawlers” or “Spiders” to search for this content across the World Wide Web, which I will discuss in the next task.


## crawler

These crawlers discover content through various means. One being by pure discovery, where a URL is visited by the crawler and information regarding the content type of the website is returned to the search engine. In fact, there are lots of information modern crawlers scrape – but we will discuss how this is used later. Another method crawlers use to discover content is by following any and all URLs found from previously crawled websites. Much like a virus in the sense that it will want to traverse/spread to everything it can.
